# RegionDCL - Code Instructions

- This repository includes essential scripts of the proposed framework RegionDCL in our paper:  **Urban Region Representation Learning ｗith OpenStreetMap Building Footprints**

## Whats' new

- We fixed the population reproduction problem in NYC and released our processed downstream_region.pkl.
- We released all raw & projected dataset and the processing script that generates the ground truth data.
- We fixed the population task reproduction problem. 
  - The data/processed/Singapore/downstream_region.pkl wrongly uses the Singapore citizens data, which ignores permanent residents and foreigners that are common in Singapore.
  - In our paper, we use more widely accepted WorldPop population data as ground truth. Now, we correct the file and our results on Singapore can be exactly reproduced.
  - You can see from data_util/downstream/SingaporeSubzone to see how the ground truth is generated.


## Quick Start

- With this repository, you can
  - Quickly reproduce the results in the paper
  - Quickly train the model and get the region embeddings of Singapore Subzones, and evaluate its performance.

### Environment

Required for evaluation:

- Please use **Miniconda or Anaconda**
- python 3.7 or 3.8 are acceptable. Higher version is not tested.
- pytorch >= 1.5.1 with GPU (for train only). We use pytorch == 1.8.2
- geopandas == 0.9.0 
  - Can be easily installed with **conda install geopandas**
- sklearn == 1.1.2 (For evaluation purpose only. Other versions may be also acceptable)
- tqdm (For progress bar only. You can use any version)
- seaborn (For visualizing the bar in quality_analysis.py only)

For training, you need to add the following package:

- pot == 0.8.2 (Python Optimal Transport Library for adaptive margin calculation)

- And ensure you have roughly 16 GB GPU available memory (If not, you need to low down the batch size in the trainer.py)

### Experiment

- For your convenience, we randomly picked one embedding for each baseline into the /baselines/ folder.
- You can quickly evaluate all baselines versus our method. 
- We strictly conduct experiments without any cherry-picking, so the result should be very close to that reported in our paper.

#### Main Experiment (Land Use / Population Inference in Singapore and NYC)

- Simply execute /evaluator/main_experiment.py. You should be able to see something like this:

- The main_experiment.py has the following options:
  - --city: can be **Singapore** or **NYC**
  - --task: can be **land** or **pop**
  - --partition: can be **default** (in Singapore this will be subzones, in NYC will be census tract) or **grid**(2km * 2km)
    - *Note that grid partition only works in Singapore*

#### Embedding Quality Analysis

- Simply execute /evaluator/quality_analysis.py. You should be able to see the picture in the paper like this:![singapore_data_sparsity_land_use](../master/visualization/singapore_data_sparsity_land_use.png?raw=true)

- The following options are available:
  - --city: can be **Singapore** or **NYC**
  - --task: can be **land** or **pop**

## Training on Singapore dataset

- Unzip the building_feature.7z in the data/processed/Singapore.
  - This is the feature extracted by **model/resnet.py**
  - So alternatively, you can use the script to train the resnet and generate new features. **Timm** library is needed.
- Run main.py. The following options are available:
  - --city: can be **Singapore** or **NYC** (The preprocessed NYC data will be available very soon)
  - --no_random: **use this to disable random point sampling.**
  - --fixed: **use this to disable the proposed adaptive margin.**
  - --save_name: the name of the building pattern embedding file. By default it is pattern_embedding
  - *For more options, please refer to the main.py.*
- After trained, you will get a new embedding file in the /embeddings/Singapore/
- The newly generated embeddings will be named RegionDCL_20.pkl, You can run experiment/evaluator.py with proper test_path to evaluate it. please change the filename in the script accordingly.

## Pre-processing (required on NYC dataset)

- We offered the preprocessing code for input shapefile. In principle it can be used for any OSM data.
  - You need **rasterio** to rasterize the building polygons. 
  - Use this if something wrong: **conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/ioos rasterio**
- The raw and projected dataset (both NYC and Singapore, projected via ArcGIS): [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WcIBcGDude5Q3_sZk_wXYpTQIPPAd6Ho/view?usp=sharing)
- The preprocess code will automatically convert buildings to images (in forms of numpy 0-1) for you, but please extract the NYC building polygons features to data/processed/NYC/building_features.npy with resnet.py on your own, as NYC has too many buildings inconvenient for us to upload.
